# PoweFailure

In this course, Paulo shines a spotlight on some of the most popular services and tools for Android developers, and demonstrates 
how they work by implementing them in a power failure monitoring application. He explores how to use Crashlytics to troubleshoot crashes, 
use Fabric.io to deploy an app for remote users so they can beta test it externally, structure the codebase to use any analytics provider,
use Firebase remote configuration to configure parameters in runtime, and more.
